# VCipher-Android-Application
This project is a simple implementation of the SDP Vigen√®re cipher, that shifts each letter in the original *Text* by a number of places that depends in the corresponding letter in the *Key Phrase* (0 for A, 1 for B, and so on), where the *Key Phrase* is repeated enough times to match the length of the (alphabetical) Text.
